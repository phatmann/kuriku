Create a todo
-------------
Each todo has an entry in the journal when it is created. A todo is created by tapping the + button.

Take action
-----------
A user can take action on a todo. They indicate this by sliding the entry to the right about halfway across. Easiest way to do this is to place finger in middle of entry and slide over. As they slide a progress bar appears. When they let go, a new entry in the journal with 1/2 progress bar is created.

If they take more action they get a new entry with a 3/4 progress bar. Etc. Kuriku always assumes you are one step away from finishing :-) 

NOTE: the app does not scroll to the top and does not animate insertion of the new entry. Without this feedback it is almost impossible to tell what happened. I will fix this ASAP.

Complete todo
-------------
A user can complete a todo. They indicate this by quickly swiping the entry to the right, or sliding all the way across. When they let go, a new entry in the journal with a full progress bar and strikeout text is created.

NOTE: the app does not scroll to the top and does not animate insertion of the new entry. Without this feedback it is almost impossible to tell what happened. I will fix this ASAP.

Repeat todo
-----------
A user can complete a todo and set it up to repeat later. They do this by sliding their finger down as they slide across. This shows a repeat icon in the progress bar. When they let go, a Repeat dialog appears. They can then choose how long to wait to repeat it. The todo is marked complete and then "frozen" with an appropriate start date.
